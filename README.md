# Formula-1 Pledge App

![Verstappen](/images/Verstappen-screenshot.png)

This is a blockchain app that focuses on Formula 1 drivers.

> It is made under the `Ethereum Blockchain`.   
> And I used `Solidity's Smart Contract` in order to get pledges (in ETH) from readers as support for their favorite F1 Drivers.

> I also integrated `Metamask` as its designated wallet and payment system.

> On the front-end, I used `Web3.js` and `React` for a helpful user interface.
